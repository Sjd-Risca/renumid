= TODO items


== Options and arguments
- Implement better subcommand support (but argparse does not ship with RHEL5)
- Add options to select specific restore uids/gids (-U 12,23 or -G 32,21)
- Add option to not cross file system boundaries (-x / --one-file-system)


== Map format
- Define map format (YAML or CSV ? Or both ?)
- Allow for catch-all mappings and host-specific mappings
  (this allows to have one single mapping file for multiple systems)


== Store format
- Store both uid and gid per path
- More efficiently handle paths requiring both a uid and gid change
  (requires changing the data structure)
- Use something better than pickle
- Check Index format version before use


== Miscellaneous
- Handle case where Index file already exists (during dump)
- Improve documentation
- Add manual page
- Send specific events to syslog


== Optional
- Option to create a full index (discard the mapping)
- Option to switch renumber/restore based on uidmap/gidmap or complete store
- Apply operations in 'chrooted' mode (in case filesystems are mounted elsewhere)
- Remember which devices were already scanned so we can skip bind-mounts with certainty
- Support both 'renumid renumber' and 'renumid-renumber' calls
- Warn on running processes using any of these UIDs/GIDs
